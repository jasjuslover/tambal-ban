# Tukang Tambal ðŸ§°

Hi guys, this is my practice project for leaflet.js. The main MVP of this project is to show "The Tire Patcher" in Bandung. I hope I can expand the range to another city next time. I think, I need to work hard gathering data from survey, or search from another source.

### Tech Stack

- Simple HTML and CSS
- Vanilla JS
- Leaflet JS

### Target

- [ ] Show nearest tire patcher
- [ ] Get current location
- [ ] Route calculation of nearest tire patcher from current location
